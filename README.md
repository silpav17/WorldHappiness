# WorldHappiness
Test data used for this project is from https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness and for the year 2019. Data is analysed for all the fields in the test data set. clustering analysis is to identify patterns in data and create groups according to those patterns. Therefore, if two points have similar characteristics, that means they have the same pattern and consequently, they belong to the same group. By doing clustering analysis we should be able to check what features usually appear together and see what characterizes a group.
